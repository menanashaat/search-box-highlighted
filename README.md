## Project Setup

This project uses **Vue 3** via a CDN to run the application without the need for complex bundling or build steps. To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage

Ensure you have an internet connection to load the Vue 3 framework from the CDN. No additional build tools (like Webpack or Vite) are required for this setup.
